//
//  One of your professors has asked you to write a program to grade her final exams, which
//  consist of only 20 multiple-choice questions. Each question has one of four possible
//  answers: A, B, C, or D. The file CorrectAnswers.txt contains the correct answers for all
//  of the questions, with each answer written on a separate line. The first line contains the
//  answer to the first question, the second line contains the answer to the second question,
//  and so forth (Download the book's source code from the Computer Science Portal at
//  www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis. You will find the file in the Chapter 07 folder.)
//
//  Write a program that reads the contents of the CorrectAnswers.txt file into a char
//  array, then reads the contents of another file, containing a student's answers, into a
//  second char array. (You can use the file StudentAnswers.txt for testing purposes. This
//  file is also in the Chapter 07 source code folder.) The program should determine the
//  number of questions that the student misesd, then display the following:
//
//  * A list of the questions missed by the student, showing the correct answer and the
//    incorrect answer provided by the student for each missed question
//  * The total number of questions missed
//  * The percentage of questions answered correctly. This can be calculated as
//
//  Correctly Answered Questions / Total Number of Questions
//
//  * If the percentage of correctly answered questions is 70% or greater, the program
//    should indicate that the student passed the exam. Otherwise, it should indicate
//    that the student failed the exam.
